I am assuming you have set up your Github. Just by signing with your email.

Now, head over to this link - https://git-scm.com/downloads/win & install git and git bash to your system. If you are coder you will have vs code in your system that we are gonna use. 
<br>
After installing , open git bash.
<br>
Run git --version (to chech the verion and confirm you have installed it)
<br>
Set up your github credential in git bash , open git bash and type 
<br>
git config --global user.name "your name which you have used to create github account."
<br>
git config --global user.email "your email which you have used to create github account."(this --global means you are defining you credential to global level on your pc.)
<br>
git config --list (to check just your user name and user eamil.) 
<br>

Open vs code 

create any folder in vs code , open vs code run 
<br>
git --version (just for confirming)
head over to git hub repository. find the code button click on it , copy the HTTPS. 
<br>
head back to vs code open terminal run 
<br>
git clone "HTTPS" (That you have cloned just now, this will clone the repository you have opened in github to vs code)
